# tenplay add-on for Kodi

http://aussieaddons.com/addons/ten/

This add-on provides a simple list of available programs from the tenplay catch-up TV service, and allows you to stream them within Kodi.

The content is only available within Australia, but it is possible to use this service outside of Australia by using Smart DNS or VPN geo-unblocking tools.

NOTE: If you are in Australia and are having issues streaming, you may need to disable any Smart DNS or VPN tools.

## Installation

Follow the Aussie Add-ons repository [installation guide](http://aussieaddons.com/installation/) to set
up the Aussie Add-ons repository.

Once the repository is installed, you can install the tenplay add-on through the Kodi Add-on manager by accessing the menus:

 * System ->
 * Settings ->
 * Add-ons ->
 * Install from repository ->
 * Aussie Add-ons (or XBMC CatchupTV AU Add-ons) ->
 * Video add-ons ->
 * tenplay ->
 * Install

The Kodi wiki also has a nice guide on [installing Add-ons via the Add-on manager](http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_manager).

Installing directly is not supported, unless you have the Aussie Add-ons/XBMC CatchupTV AU repository already configured, as this add-on has some dependencies that must be installed before it will work.
